                    During COVID-19, my clinical rotations were put on hold. Likewise, other pharmacy, medicine, and healthcare professional students were put in a similar situation. Despite not being able to contribute on the front lines, these students banded together to form 3D PPE GTHA with the goal of supplying 3D printed face shields to front line workers as the shortage of personal protective equipment continued throughout the pandemic.

                    With the support of our donors, volunteers and community printers, we were able to deliver 25,000 face shields to hospitals, clinics, long-term care homes, and shelters across the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Region. Our initative had also won the COVID-19 Student Engagement Award from the University of Toronto.
